Take a directory full of like-named files. 
Splits a filename and then appends a prefix (IE a music folder with unappealing names (01 - Song Title))

Changes:
8/29/2012 v0.1 Working
Program grabs a directory, asks you what you would like to split the filename on, what you want to append to the front of it and then makes the changes and saves.

Still Need to Complete:
- Validation for splitting and prefix inputs
- Validation for no valid files/empty directory
- Error checking for files with multiple splits (ex: 01 - Song Title   - Other info)
